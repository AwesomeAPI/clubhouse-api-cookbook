# Welcome to the Clubhouse REST API Cookbook
The Clubhouse REST API is a powerful tool that can make your work easier and enhance the ways that you use your Clubhouse data. 
We created this material to get you started using the Clubhouse REST API to solve common requests, even if you don't regularly use APIs.

Maybe you need to get average Cycle time for the Epic your team just completed, or you need to change the Label for uncompleted work in a Sprint; this will show you how.

Some of these examples can be run as is. All of the example code for specific tasks will show you where to make small changes to interact with the data in your Clubhouse account.  
You can also use this material as a starting place and make further adjustments for your particular needs.


Do you have an example you think we should cover? Please let us know! You can open an Issue on this repository so other teams can publicly add their interest, or email support@clubbouse.io.

Found a typo or other small issue? Please feel free to submit a PR!

Questions and suggestions are welcome as Issues, or send us an email support@clubhouse.io. We'd love to hear from you!

## Requirements
All of the cookbook scripts are written in Python 3 and use the [Requests Library](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).
If you're comfortable checking your Python installation, installing Requests, using a virtual environment, and setting environment variables, please jump to [the main table of contents](link to cookbook-contents doc)

If you'd like a walk-through of getting set up to run these example scripts, please check out the setup instructions [for Mac](https://github.com/clubhouse/api-cookbook/blob/master/set-up-instructions.md) or [for PC](https://github.com/clubhouse/api-cookbook/blob/master/windows-set-up-instructions.md)
